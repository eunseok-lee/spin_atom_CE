This program is a part of the spin-atom CE package for the layered LNC system.
This program selects a set of cluster functions to produce the lowest cross validation score for given correlation matrix, using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm to scan the configurational space.
The corresponding effective cluster interactions are also obtained.
To compile this program, GNU Scientific Library (GSL) should be pre-installed. Then, type 'make' at the prompt.

>> make

It will build an executable, run_findcluster. Note that the Makefile is writen based on mpicc. If your system runs different C-compilers, you need to update 'CC' and 'CFLAGS' in Makefile correspondingly. Your system should also have gsl library installed (refer to https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ for further information).

To run the executable, the parameters in the following list should be provided (these parameters should be written in param.dat).

1) n_corr_mat_ug_row: the number of data set after post processing
2) n_non_singular_col: the number of non-singular cluster functions 
3) howmanycluster: the number of cluster functions to be selected
4) max_iter: maximum number of iteration
5) kT: the thermal energy parameter in Boltzmann factor, in eV 
6) cvs_tol: the critical value of cross-validation-score to finish the iteration
7) dispfreq: frequency of displaying & storing 

In addition to param.dat, the following files also should be provided.
1) corr_mat_ugs.dat: the correlation matrix after post processing
2) Ef_ug.dat: the formation energy after post processing
3) usefulcorr_col.dat: the list of non-singular cluster functions
4) Ef_orig.dat: the formation energy of each data set - size of ndata

The files 1)-4) can provided from the result of running data_to_corr_mat (another program of the package), or other external programs.

You can run the executable as follows.

>>./run_findcluster

The results will be stored in dir_result, which will be created or updated during the running, as listed in the following list.

1) cluster_set_N%d.dat: the selected cluster functions. The second column of this file can be used as the input file (cluster_set_min.dat) for predictstructure_ce (sub-program 4)
2) x.dat: the effective cluster interactions

These results can be used for predictstructure_ce.
